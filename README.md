## Report

Creating a project on Android Studio with Kotlin can be a challenging task for beginners. The process can be overwhelming due to the amount of complex information involved, especially if you are not familiar with the Kotlin programming language.

One challenge is understanding the various components and libraries involved in Android app development. These include the activities, fragments, views, intents, and services, to mention a few. It can be difficult to understand how these components fit together and how to use them effectively.

Learning the syntax and best practices of Kotlin can be a daunting task, especially for those who are new to programming despite our classes, to really understand how to create Apps using Android Studio we need more classes and practice

Furthermore, the Android platform is constantly evolving, and keeping up with the latest changes and updates can be a challenge. This can make it difficult to find accurate and up-to-date information about Android development.

In conclusion, creating an Android project with Kotlin can be a challenging task for beginners due to the setup process, the complexity of the components involved, the learning curve of Kotlin programming language, and the constant evolution of the Android platform.
